# Tool Collection

This is really just a dumping ground for various tools I have written. Some may have uses outside of my world, so if you happen to stumble across this site, feel free to use them per the license agreement.

Tools may get removed if I've created a better way of doing something and made into a new repository. Some of these scripts are really bad but may fill a stop gap or help you automate something better.

###Some tools that are needed for some of the scripts:
-Windows FCIV

-Windows Remote Server Administration Tools

-SubInACL from Microsoft

###Dependencies needed for the Python scripts:
-all built-in
